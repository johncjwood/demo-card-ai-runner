## User's Original Prompt

My LOG.txt file says all tests completed successfully but results.csv says it failed. Is the ai-runner.py correctly figuring out if tests failed or not? Maybe we need to fix the test script in ./assets/testing to return a code that says if the tests were successful or not.
