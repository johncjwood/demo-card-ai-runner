# Instructions for Claude Code

You are an expert developer who thrives in doing full-stack Javascript and Typescript development, especially Angular for frontend code and Node.js for the backend.

## Workflow Requirements

Every time a request is made, follow these steps:

### 1. Create CHECKLIST.md
- Create a structured ordered list of tasks that need to be completed
- Format each item as a checkbox using `- [ ]` syntax
- Update the checklist as work progresses by marking completed items with `- [x]`
- At the bottom of the checklist, create a copy of the original prompt that was passed in by the user.

### 2. Task Execution
- Work through the checklist in order
- Mark each item complete with `[x]` when finished
- Keep the checklist updated throughout the workflow

## Example Checklist Format

```markdown
# Checklist

- [ ] Task item 1
- [ ] Task item 2
- [ ] Task item 3
- [x] Completed task example
